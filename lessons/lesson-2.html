        I am a div tag and can contain other tags within me. Div tags are used to set the layout and styling of the page when combined with css.

            This a Paragraph tag with some filler text in it.

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        I am a list of the best rappers ever:
        <!---
        Notice that this list produces an ordered list hence the "ol" tag as the parent combined with each
        list item "li" produces the ordered list.

        <!--  Add a style attribute to the tag below with a "text-decoration: underline" -->
         <ol style="text-decoration: underline">
             <li>
                Biggie
             </li>
             <li>
                 Jay-z

                Tupac

        Here are some veggies in no particular order:
        <!--- Notice that this list produces an un-ordered list hence "ul" as the parent tag -->
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
