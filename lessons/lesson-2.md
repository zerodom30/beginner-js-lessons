#Lesson 2 

Before we get into javascript let's go over some other aspects of html. 

## Cascading StyleSheets aka CSS

CSS is used to style the webpage markup. This can be done a few different ways: 
- Creating inline css on an HTML tag
- Creating a style tag within the HTML page and define the styles there
- Creating a style tag within a `.css` file and import it into the page

There some more advanced variations on this but for now that is all we are going to be concerned with.

In this lesson we will have a look at some html tags and how they are styled. Each HTML tag can also take properties 
called attributes to add to their various abilities. We will be taking a look at the style attribute to see how we can 
style page.
